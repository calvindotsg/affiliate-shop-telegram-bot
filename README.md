# Telegram Affiliate Bot

## Overview

This Telegram bot enables seamless affiliate marketing within group chats by generating personalized tracking links for users. It simplifies the process of sharing and managing affiliate links while ensuring each user receives a unique, trackable link.

## Business Use Case

Affiliate marketing often requires users to register and generate unique tracking links manually, which can be cumbersome. This bot automates the process by integrating with an existing affiliate system and generating user-specific links based on their registration status.

### Key Benefits:

- **Automation**: Eliminates the need for manual link generation, ensuring users always receive the correct tracking link.
- **Personalization**: Each user gets a unique tracking link, improving accuracy in performance tracking.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works directly within Telegram groups, enabling real-time access to affiliate links.
- **Increased Engagement**: Encourages users to interact with the bot and participate in affiliate programs effortlessly.

## Problem Statement

Traditional affiliate marketing platforms require users to visit external sites, log in, and retrieve tracking links manually. This leads to:

- **User Drop-off**: Many users abandon the process due to complexity.
- **Tracking Issues**: Generic links make it harder to track individual user performance.
- **Lower Conversions**: Extra steps reduce engagement and conversion rates.

This Telegram bot solves these issues by allowing users to generate tracking links with a single command inside a group chat.

- **User Registration & Validation**: Checks if the user is registered and prompts for registration if needed.
- **Affiliate Link Generation**: Creates a tracking link unique to each user and merchant.
- **Firestore Database Integration**: Stores and retrieves user data for seamless tracking.
- **State Management**: Ensures smooth user interactions with different states:
  1. Not Started
  2. Received Merchant Command
  3. User Not Registered
  4. User Registered
  5. Sent Unique Tracking Link
